Frustration that design education has been reduced to a handful of feal good quotes, an ineffective standardised design process, unquestioned research activities and no mention of philosophy or critical thought.

The 12 sections are:</p><ul><li><p>Introduction: background into the industry and some of the problems</p></li><li><p>What is Design?: looking at, where design came from and some misconceptions about how to design</p></li><li><p>Design Process: the elements of a design process. You'll then create your design process</p></li><li><p>Critical Thinking: the core skill to design effectively, how to challenge ideas, especially your own</p></li><li><p>Experience Economy: experience is vital to create products people love, yet most people are ignoring it!</p></li><li><p>Creativity: you can learn to be creative, I'll show you what it is and how to get it!</p></li><li><p>Perception: looking at how people see the world and how we can design for them (people)</p></li><li><p>Usability: let's make sure your product is easy to use and doesn't frustrate</p></li><li><p>Figma: is a rapid design and prototyping tool, you'll learn to mock up your designs</p></li><li><p>Form &amp;&nbsp;Function: why your product has to look good and what to do about it</p></li><li><p>Minimalism: minimalism is hard and we often get it wrong</p></li><li><p>Balance: you can have too much of anything. lets balance standards with trends</p></li></ul><p><strong>Is this course for me?</strong></p><p>I created The Master Digital Product Design Course to fill many of the holes in other product design courses, for this reason, I believe it'll be useful for a seasoned designer.&nbsp; I've also created it with the beginner in mind so if you have never designed anything you will be just at home (and everyone has designed something before, you just don't know it!). </p><p>As well as designers I&nbsp;also had in mind all the people who project manage, own or develop digital products.

It's essentially about empowering people to do the things they want to do, which is both fun and gratifying. And, <strong>having a great user experience drives business success</strong>.<br></p><p><strong>Learning UX, however, can be a challenge</strong>. Since it's a relatively young field, there's no real gold standard yet for how things are practiced, or taught, which can frustrate people who are just trying to learn things the right way, in order to apply UX immediately to what they're doing, as well as students looking to become practitioners.</p><p>I created this course because I believe your time is precious, and you shouldn't have to hunt around to get a practical foundation in UX. Or watch 24 hours of videos. This course takes you through the <strong>key concepts and steps of UX, as they would occur across a real-world project</strong>, so you <strong>gain a complete understanding of how to practice UX</strong> - from Research, to Strategy, to Design. And the confidence that comes with these new skills.</p><p>There's a fair bit of material to share, but the content is mostly<strong> short, entertaining, to-the-point videos</strong>, followed by <strong>assignments where you'll apply what you're learning</strong> so it sinks in. And, I'm confident you'll like this material because I've already taught it to <strong>Thousands of professionals and university students</strong> who have<strong> enjoyed and benefited from it.</strong></p><p>Whether you need to effectively learn UX and apply it immediately, or you're looking to supplement your skillset, or you're just curious about entering this fun and lucrative field, this course is designed for you</p><p>After taking the course you'll possess a powerful understanding of UX and the key activities related to the field. You'll also be able to take that knowledge, and put it to use to <strong>make better work and advance your career!  </strong>(And, you'll have some great portfolio pieces if you complete the assignments!)</p><p>See you in class!<br></p><p>- Brendan</p>","suitableLearners":["People who want to enter the UX field and become practitioners","Professionals who want or need to add UX to their skill set","Anyone at an agency or company who needs to quickly learn real-world UX fundamentals you can use on the job"],"sections":[]},"messages":{"welcome":"","congratulations":""},"history":{"createdAt":"2019-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","createdBy":"622c1f382e96f2828a7dae2d","publishedAt":"2019-03-18T00:00:00.000Z"},"promotions":{"discountPrice":275280,"startAt":"2022-01-31T17:00:00.000Z","endAt":"2023-01-31T17:00:00.000Z","enabled":true}},{"status":"active","categories":["625e82a09c9b04f3f624d732","625e83039c9b04f3f624d78c"],"topics":[],"reviews":[],"meta":{"ratingCount":1170,"studentCount":2897,"avgRatingScore":4.3620405,"contentVideoLength":12198},"basicInfo":{"udemyCourseId":2230950,"slug":"ux-fundamentals-user-testing","title":"UX Fundamentals: User Testing","subtitle":"Get better in UX by understanding your users","image":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/240x135/2230950_66b4.jpg","price":1261470,"lan":"en","level":"intermediate","currency":"vnd","isFree":false},"details":{"objectives":["User Testing Basics","UX Resources and Tips","Useful techniques for gathering information","Best tools to perform User Tests"],"requirements":["Basic understanding of UX"],"description":"<p>Being a UX designer does not mean you should be able to design any feature or interface perfectly.

Spheres, Cubes, Cones, and Cylinders. These are the elements that make up almost everything around us.</p></li><li><p>Next youâll be learning about color theory and which colors to choose for your shadows and lights. Color is an essential part of establishing the mood in a painting.</p></li><li><p>After this youâll be combining the basic forms in order to bring what weâve learned so far together and make some recognizable scenes.</p></li><li><p>Next we move on to jumping straight into building our first scene. Youâll start by drawing out a line work and setting up the perspective exactly how I taught you in the perspective lessons. Weâll focus on composition and object placement to make the most of the space in our canvas. Focusing heavily on setting up our image to achieve a feeling of depth, which is one of the most important things in environment painting.</p></li><li><p>After this we refine the sketch to further enhance the idea. Redrawing it and making sure all of our elements are in place before painting.</p></li><li><p>Next weâll begin by roughly painting the main colors in. Figuring out what color everything is as well as how things change color the further they get away. Applying what we learned earlier in the color theory into some real painting situations.</p></li><li><p>Lastly after we get the main elements of our painting established. Our colors in place, and everything set up. Weâll start detailing the painting and adding all the little elements that bring the painting to life. Painting grass, wood, fencing and trees.</p></li><li><p>In the next session weâll do another line work. Starting rough and working cleaner. Iâll teach you to draw on top of a 3 point perspective grid.</p></li><li><p>This painting will be started by first finding all of our shadows before we start with colors. Itâs important to know our shadows and lighting before we start adding details.</p></li><li><p>After this the next few hours are spent adding tons and tons of detail. Iâll be explaining how high detail images are really just a series of decisions made over and over and is actually quite simple.

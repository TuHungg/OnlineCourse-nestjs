"],"description":"<p><strong></strong><strong>**WELCOME TO THE #1 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COURSE ON UDEMY**</strong></p>\n\n<p>Are you ready to take your business <strong>from 0 USD to a multi million dollar business </strong>in the <strong>next 2-4 years </strong>and receive your <strong>258 Page Course Study Book</strong>? This course will teach you everything you need to know from first-hand experience about building and scaling businesses from scratch without any or very little money. I started my first business at the age of <strong>16</strong> and scaled it to a <strong>7-figure business within 2 years</strong>. At age<strong> 19,</strong> I started the company <strong>Teaching Hero</strong> which sells online education in now already over <strong>128 countries</strong>. In <strong></strong>the last few years, I taught students from all over the world how to build <strong>5-, 6- and 7-figure businesses</strong> quickly. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\"Most Udemy instructors who teach about business development have never built a successful business. I HAVE BUILT MULTIPLE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES IN MORE THAN 128 COUNTRIES. I have been through the ups and downs. And will lay out everything I have learned. This course will save you years of failure and hardship, and will jumpstart your business success!\" </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I <em>DO NOT promise you that you will be a millionaire by next week but I can say with certainty that if you study and apply what I teach in this course, you could become financially independent within the next 2-4 years!</em> Whether you are 15 years old or 85 years old, this course is right for you! <strong>In this course, I will reveal my strategy how I scaled my businesses and will explain to you step by step how you can do that too. </strong>I do not like messing around. That's why I am putting my brain on paper here in this course. Furthermore, this course is project-based so that you can apply what you've learned right away in the real world. This course is for everyone who wants to <strong>escape the 9 to 5 job</strong> and wants to start a successful business. Owning my own business gave me incredible freedom and I want to help you achieve that freedom as well. That's why I put together this <strong>14 Hour long Business Development Masterclass</strong> in order for you to build and scale businesses. In this masterclass, we will focus on: </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>1. BRAND-BUILDING: We will together learn how to build a brand that lasts. In this part of the course, we will focus on <strong>long-term sales initiatives </strong>and how to <strong>create a reliable customer base</strong> that creates a <strong>consistent income stream</strong> for you and ensures all further business development. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>2. CUSTOMER RESEARCH: I will teach you in detail how to make sure that <strong>your product will sell before you even create it</strong>. In order to have that certainty, we need to learn about <strong>customer research</strong>. Customer research mostly gets underestimated and that's why many startups fail due to a lack of certainty about <strong>future market behaviors and their product's place in the market</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>3. BUILDING &amp; SCALING A BUSINESS WITHOUT MONEY: In this part of the course, I will present you ways how to build a business without investing any or only very little money. For example,<strong> I started Teaching Hero with 26 USD and scaled it to a business that earns me 5000 USD/month in less than 3 months.</strong> I will present you in this part of the course <strong>7 different business ideas</strong> that don't require any or only very little capital. <em>You may copy these ideas and start your (first) own business. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>4. PRODUCT &amp; LOGO DESIGN: In this part of the course, I will show you how to create the perfect product design and how to come up with a striking logo that attracts people to buy. In the last years, <strong>I launched more businesses than I can count with my hands and always had to come up with great logos</strong>. I will show you what kind of logo I looked out for and how we created our logos. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>5. PROBLEMS IN A BUSINESS &amp; HOW TO FIX THEM: <strong>No business has no problems during the development of the company</strong>. In this part of the course, I will show you how to <strong>deal with problems in your business and grow from them</strong>. Whether it is <em>not finding the right employees</em> or <em>them leaving the company</em>, whether it is <strong>monetary problems or decreases in sales</strong>, I have been through it and will share everything I have learned with you in this chapter! </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>6. STARTUP PITCHING: I have not just been an entrepreneur, I have also been an <strong>investor</strong> and know what to look out for when listening to startup pitches. I know everything about venture capital what there is to know and will share all of that knowledge with you. We will furthermore talk about <strong>self-consciousness and how to develop a great pitching posture</strong>. In this part of the course, we will have a look at how to use the <strong>10 step startup pitching formula</strong> and which <strong>focus investors put on pitch decks</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>7. SALES STRATEGIES: I will show you how you can <strong>develop and analyze any sales technique</strong> and how to sell literally anything. We will talk about <strong>direct and intermediary sales</strong> as well as every sales strategy you could imagine. We will furthermore take apart sales strategies that other people used, copy the best bits and leave the rest for history. After this chapter you will be able to <strong>match a </strong><strong>sales strategy to your personality type and use it in different market environments</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>8. E-MAIL MARKETING: I will show you, <strong>how I generated a 1.6 million people e-mail list in less than 1 year </strong>and how you can do that too. I will show you live how you can generate thousands of e-mail addresses from companies such as <strong>Google or Bing</strong>. <em>In the end, e-mail marketing can be extremely valuable, especially if you do not have a proper marketing budget yet and want to create a loyal customer base. </em> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>9. SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING: We will furthermore also dive into social media marketing (<strong>Facebook and Snapchat mostly</strong>). <em>We will additionally talk about thank you marketing and how to keep your customers happy! </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>COURSE REVIEWS</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>\"I have struggled with scaling my business for years now, but in the last few weeks after taking Leon's course, I scaled my lawn business from 500 USD/month to 4000 USD/month and now think about doing it full-time.

I used to be the same way and I spent years refining my system in order to run a successful freelance business. My name is Jordan Hudgens and I'll be your instructor for this course. In addition to being an instructor I also have a freelance development business that <strong>generated over $295,000</strong> last year alone. In fact, in one month I made over $43,000 in freelance work. And in this course I'm going to walk through the exact process I used to build my freelance service so that you can learn from it and launch your own business.</p><p>I have spent the last year putting together this curriculum based on my own real world experiences with clients. This includes discussing the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to becoming a freelancer. Many other freelancing courses are filled with 1-2 hours worth of theoretical concepts. I took a different approach and focus 100% on practical real life experiences so that you can truly use this course to launch a freelance business. The result is that this course gives you <strong>2 to 3 times more material than most other freelancing systems</strong>.</p><p>I've organized the course into practical sections so that you can follow along, this includes:</p><p><strong>Preparing for the launch of your business.</strong> Including how to schedule your launch, how to&nbsp;create&nbsp;a portfolio that actually gets clients, how to&nbsp;craft&nbsp;a list of template proposals, and every other component you'll need in order to start your business.</p><p>Next we'll move onto the top challenge freelancers come across:<strong> how to get clients</strong>! This was the most difficult obstacle for me to overcome when I started my freelance business and I walk you through my marketing system that generated so many clients that I had to hire additional freelancers to help take on all of the new clients that were signing up.</p><p>As important as getting clients is when it comes to launching a freelance business I don't end the course there. I dedicate sections to the topics of <strong>managing projects</strong>, testing for <strong>code quality</strong>, working with <strong>legacy applications</strong>, and <strong>how to manage client communication</strong> to ensure that your clients become your biggest fans.</p><p><strong><em>If the idea of hard work doesn't scare you off and if the concept of making your own schedule and being able to work from anywhere in the world is appealing, then this is the course for you.</em></strong></p><p>Since these concepts are part of my life's work, I didn't simply record myself discussing the material. I also wrote a full book on how you can launch your freelance business called: <em>The Freelancer's Manifesto</em>, and I'm giving every student that signs up for this course a copy completely for free <em>(sold for $30 online and in stores)</em>. The book is a great companion to the video lessons and includes additional stories and examples from my own freelance experience.</p><p>In addition to the book, when you sign up for the course I will also send you all of the documents you'll need in order to become a freelancer, including: the legal agreements I give to clients, my full list of template proposals, and as with all my other courses you can message me anytime with any questions that you may have.</p><p>Please feel free to review the course curriculum and I look forward to going through the material with you on your freelance journey!</p>","suitableLearners":["This course is for developers and designers who want to build their own freelance businesses, including full time and part time work."],"sections":[]},"messages":{"welcome":"","congratulations":""},"history":{"createdAt":"2021-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","createdBy":"622c1f382e96f2828a7dae2d","publishedAt":"2021-03-19T00:00:00.000Z"},"promotions":{"discountPrice":275280,"startAt":"2022-01-31T17:00:00.000Z","endAt":"2023-01-31T17:00:00.000Z","enabled":true}},{"status":"active","categories":["625e7f939c9b04f3f624d66b","625e7fa79c9b04f3f624d677"],"topics":[],"reviews":[],"meta":{"ratingCount":443,"studentCount":2555,"avgRatingScore":4.2331867,"contentVideoLength":4706},"basicInfo":{"udemyCourseId":482996,"slug":"design-thinking-for-entrepreneurs-startups-part-1","title":"Design thinking for entrepreneurs & startups (part 1)","subtitle":"An intro to the first two steps of the 'design thinking' process: developing empathy & framing the problem/opportunity.","image":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/240x135/482996_83ad_17.jpg","price":458570,"lan":"en","level":"all","currency":"vnd","isFree":false},"details":{"objectives":["Discover and understand how to apply the first few steps of the design process to your new venture.","Improve your ability to think more like a designer (open to opportunities) rather than as a manager focused on constraints.","Strengthen your empathy,  meaning your ability to better understand people and their needs.","The opportunity to join Bootpeers a community of budding entrepreneurs learning together about lean methodologies and design thinking.

With the pandemic ending more businesses than ever, now is the perfect time to get started generating sales and money online by creating simple low content books or high content books without doing the work yourself!</p><p>After grinding various ways of making money online, nothing ever stuck with me; affiliate marketing, Amazon FBA, list building etc etc - until I&nbsp;started creating low cost books that sold like <strong>HOT&nbsp;CAKES</strong>&nbsp;on Amazon. And the great part was, I&nbsp;didn't even put money into the business...</p><p>I&nbsp;created my first paperback book back in October 2018, and that <strong>ONE&nbsp;book has made over $2500 of pure profit</strong>. Needless to say, I&nbsp;have many many more books on the Amazon marketplace making me sales every single day. And what's even better, is that I&nbsp;haven't worked on this business for 5 MONTHS, yet sales continue to flood in.</p><p><strong>Now it's your turn. </strong></p><p>I&nbsp;strongly believe that if I&nbsp;can make this type of profit, then you can too. </p><p>Inside this course<strong> you will learn EVERYTHING</strong> that I&nbsp;have done over the years, everything I've done to PERFECT&nbsp;selling books on Amazon. With a mixture of LOW&nbsp;CONTENT and high content books, you'll be able to see a steady income every single month.</p><p>What makes my course so unique, is that you won't have to guess where to start. There is no guess work here. From creating a publishing account to managing your books after they are live on the Amazon store, and everything in-between - I've got you covered.</p><p><strong>What if I&nbsp;have not much to invest into this?&nbsp; </strong>I've got you covered here. I&nbsp;started with nothing, literally $0, and inside the course I&nbsp;will share with you how you can do the same. If you have around $10, you can get started even quicker. If you have $100, you can blow the socks on this Amazon business in no time.</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to run? </strong>Once you have books on the Amazon store, they will continue to make you royalties for years to come. How many books and how much you earn from this, is down to how much time and effort you put in. Expect to start seeing sales after a few weeks though.</p><p><strong>How much writing/designing do I&nbsp;need to do? </strong>None, if you don't want to. In the course I&nbsp;show you how you can create your entire business without writing a single word or designing a single book cover (this will obviously take a little investment), but if you want to write the content yourself, I will show you how to do that too!</p><p><strong>Inside the course, I&nbsp;don't waste time</strong> with things that won't make you money. Facebook ads, blogs, websites, weird traffic sources, paying for reviews - if it's not making me money, then I&nbsp;don't include it in the course. What you are getting inside the course, is a <strong><em>SUCCESSFUL</em></strong>&nbsp;blueprint to making money with Amazon publishing.</p><p><strong>What are low content books?&nbsp;Is that all I&nbsp;will be selling? </strong>Low content books are books with little to no content, like sketchbooks, coloring books, journals, logbooks etc - these are super easy to make and can supplement your income nicely. But, I&nbsp;don't teach how to just make low content books, I&nbsp;share my endgame strategy for creating higher content high QUALITY&nbsp;books that stick in the marketplace for years and years. </p><p>I&nbsp;have generated over <strong>$60,000 of profit</strong> from what I&nbsp;teach in this course.<strong> My TOTAL outgoings are LESS&nbsp;THAN&nbsp;$400. </strong></p><p>Let that sink in and decide if you want to get involved too.</p><p><br></p>","suitableLearners":["Students who are struggling to make money on Amazon KDP","Students with the desire to create a passive income for life"],"sections":[]},"messages":{"welcome":"","congratulations":""},"history":{"createdAt":"2021-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","createdBy":"622c1f382e96f2828a7dae2d","publishedAt":"2021-05-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"promotions":{"discountPrice":275280,"startAt":"2022-01-31T17:00:00.000Z","endAt":"2023-01-31T17:00:00.000Z","enabled":true}}]

Adding a new feature or fixing a bug may break several other places in the application, and covering all those edge cases with <strong>manual testing</strong> ends up being <strong>extremely painful</strong> and <strong>nearly impossible</strong>. <br></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Automated testing is a practice that has been adopted by a lot of <strong>successful software development teams</strong> over the past decade. You simply <strong>write code to test your application</strong>, and then run those tests in an automated fashion. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, your development time increases a bit because you need to write extra code to test your production code. However, that is <strong>the cost that you pay only once</strong>. Once you have those tests in place, you can <strong>run several thousands of them in just a few seconds over and over</strong>. Compare that with the time required to manually test every bit of your application! </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With automated testing, you <strong>spend less time fixing bugs</strong> and doing manual repetitive tests every time you add a new feature or fix a bug. Instead, you can spend your time doing more fun things. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course, Mosh, <strong>author of several best selling courses on Udemy</strong>, takes you from the ground and gives you <strong>a solid foundation</strong> to write automated tests for your Angular apps.

The focus of this course is on testing for the web—we'll be working with REST APIs and web applications, and technologies such as unittest, Postman, and Selenium WebDriver.</p><p>Fear not though, after going through this course, you'll be able to take your new testing knowledge and apply it to any project, even non-web projects!</p><p><strong>What will you work with?</strong></p><p>This course is jam-packed with all the latest technologies for you to use professionally and in personal projects:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>unittest</strong> library, Python's standard automated software&nbsp;testing library;</p></li><li><p><strong>Mocking and patching</strong>, two essential tools to reduce dependencies when testing;</p></li><li><p><strong>unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing</strong>—all types of testing to have you fully covered;</p></li><li><p><strong>Postman</strong> for easy collaboration and testing while developing;</p></li><li><p><strong>Selenium WebDriver</strong> for <strong>automated browser tests</strong>;</p></li><li><p><strong>Git</strong> and <strong>Travis</strong> for <strong>continuous integration</strong> of your project.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Fundamental Software&nbsp;Testing Skills</strong></p><p>We will cover every fundamental software testing skill that you need to know in order to get a job testing or to apply these skills in your existing projects.</p><p>From things like <strong>mocking and patching</strong> using the <strong>unittest</strong> library, which reduce dependencies and turn complex tests to simple ones; to looking at all types of testing: simple unit tests to large system tests and even customer acceptance tests.</p><p><strong>The Testing Pyramid</strong></p><p>The Testing Pyramid says you should have a lot of <strong>unit tests</strong>, slightly fewer <strong>integration tests</strong>, even fewer <strong>system tests</strong>, and as few <strong>acceptance tests</strong> as possible.</p><p>Throughout the course we work on this concept, making sure that we have <strong>full coverage</strong> of every component of our system with unit tests. Then we test the dependencies using integration tests. Finally, we cover the entire system and its assumptions using system tests. Of course, we'll also look at what acceptance testing is, how we come up with acceptance tests, and some of the best ways to write acceptance tests for a web application using <strong>Behavior-Driven Development</strong> and <strong>Selenium WebDriver</strong>.</p><p><strong>Automated Browser Testing with Selenium WebDriver</strong></p><p>Selenium WebDriver is extremely powerful, particularly when coupled with the efficient and tried-and-tested approach recommended in this course. We'll <strong>design our acceptance tests professionally</strong>—just the way you'd do at a software testing job. We'll use <strong>page models</strong>, <strong>locators</strong>, and <strong>step definitions</strong> to structure the automated tests in a reusable way. The customers will be able to come up with acceptance tests that you can easily translate to code.</p><p>We'll also learn about <strong>implicit and explicit waits</strong> with Selenium WebDriver and Python, a key concept to speed up the runtime of your acceptance tests.</p><p><strong>Continuous Integration</strong></p><p>We also cover how you can take automated testing much further in your projects.</p><p>By implementing a <strong>Continuous Integration pipeline</strong> that runs your tests whenever you make any changes, you'll have much higher quality in your projects and not let any pesky bugs pass you by. We'll look at putting our projects in GitHub and liking the CI pipeline with them.</p><p><strong>I'm really excited to guide you through this course!</strong></p><p>Join me in this automated testing journey.

Learn how to eliminate boilerplate setup and teardown code, run multiple tests at the same time, and track the history of your test runs to identify slow or problematic tests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Learn lessons collected over years of professional automation in just a few hours.</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>Never manage test suites again - let them manage themselves</li><li>Achieve blazing fast test runs with parallel execution</li><li>More coverage with less code</li><li>Industry-ready test structure</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>A Bulletproof approach to automation fundamentals </strong> Python is one of the most popular languages in the world, and the demand for it is only increasing. Pytest is one of the most actively maintained testing frameworks in the industry, and provides an incredible set of tools for faster, less-stressful testing.</p>\n\n<p>Automated testing is one of the most in-demand fields in today's tech market, but there is very little guidance on how the engineer can move from writing tests to building a robust test architecture. Reliable test frameworks save compounding amounts of time and money, improve trust between testers and developers, and make for happier testers. Happy testers are more productive, more effective, and tend to grow within the organization. Everyone wins.</p>\n\n<p>The most widely circulated videos on these topics speak only to the technologies themselves, and do not offer viable implementation guidance or valuable industry practices. I have made these valuable practices the focus of this course.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Content and Overview </strong>Suitable for those comfortable with basic Python and Object-Oriented Programming concepts, these lectures build a rock-solid foundation of skills required to automate at a professional level.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning with a brief introduction and a step-by-step setup of Pytest, this course allows you to watch as I walk you through each action, explaining as we go.</p>\n\n<p>We will discuss what makes a good framework, and maybe more importantly, what makes a bad one. We will learn how to use test searching to avoid cumbersome test suites, and how fixtures can eliminate up to 80% of the code in a bloated codebase.</p>\n\n<p>Students completing the course will have the knowledge to build high-performance, well-organized, scalable test frameworks at the professional level.</p>\n\n<p>Equipped with code samples, short quizzes, and info-rich videos, you’ll have no trouble following along with the concepts, and I am always available for questions.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, automating is a blast, and I wish more people did it. Let me rephrase that - I wish more people did it, and did it well! We need more people like you executing effective, high-value automation solutions, so let's get started on this journey together!</p>",

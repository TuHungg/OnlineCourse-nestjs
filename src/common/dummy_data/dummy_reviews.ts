The course just seems like a race through a gazillion of concepts, intertwined and all thrown at you at the same time. And then, once you finally start to begind to grasp some of it, the instructor jumps to something completely different right in the middle of a lecture. The catchphrases such as \"... so the solution to this is ... but this creates another problem...\" just add to your frustration. Most modules come with pre-written code which is not explained and just gets modified during a lecture leaving you comlpletely baffled at the end. Hundreds and hudreds of comments of other students pointing out the confusing teaching style are met with other comments suggesting to just re-watch an re-watch the lectures.. Even if you just type along (having lost the plot much earlier) it's near impossible to keep up with the instructor, as he jusmps all over the code very quickly, and his screen is so zoomed it you only see like 16 lines of code. Perhaps Max should just stick to coding for work and not teaching...",
